# Morse-Code-Converter

Utilized the Arduino micro-controller and C++ (Arduino IDE) to create an efficient word to Morse code translator. A string of English characters are inputted and the program traverses through the string to match the Morse code audio sequence to each letter in order to output the final Morse code translation via a piezoelectric buzzer.
